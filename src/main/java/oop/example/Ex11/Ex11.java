        //Currency Conversion
        /*At some point, you might have to deal with currency exchange rates,
        and youâ€™ll need to ensure your calculations are as precise as possible.
        Write a program that converts currency. Specifically, convert euros to
        U.S. dollars. Prompt for the amount of money in euros you have, and
        prompt for the current exchange rate of the euro. Print out the new
        amount in U.S. dollars.

        The formula for currency conversion is derived from

            c_to / c_from = rate
        where
            c_to is the amount in U.S. dollars.
            c_from is the amount in euros.
            rate is the per-unit current exchange rate from c_from to c_to.

        Example Output
        How many euros are you exchanging? 81
        What is the exchange rate? 1.3751
        81 euros at an exchange rate of 1.3751 is
        111.38 U.S. dollars.

        Constraints
        Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the next penny.
        Use a single output statement.*/

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("How many euros are you exchanging? ");
        double numOfEuros = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("What is the exchange rate? ");
        double exchangeRate = input.nextDouble();

        double usd = numOfEuros * exchangeRate;
        String roundedUSD = String.format("%.2f", usd);

        //FIXME replace hardcoded data
        System.out.print(numOfEuros + " euros at an exchange rate of " + exchangeRate + " is\n" +
                roundedUSD + " U.S. dollars.");

    }

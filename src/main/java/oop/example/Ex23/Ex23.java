        //Troubleshooting Car Issues
        /*An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence
        program that uses a knowledge base and a set of rules to
        perform a task that a human expert might do. Many websites
        are available that will help you self-diagnose a medical
        issue by answering a series of questions. And many hardware
        and software companies offer online troubleshooting tools to
        help people solve simple technical issues before calling a
        human. Create a program that walks the user through
        troubleshooting issues with a car. Use the following decision
        tree to build the system:

        @startuml
        if (Is the car silent when you turn the key?) then (yes)
            if (Are the battery terminals corroded?) then (yes)
                :Clean terminals and try starting again.;
                stop
            else (no)
                :Replace cables and try again.;
                stop
            endif
        else (no)
            if (Does the car make a slicking noise?) then (yes)
                :Replace the battery.;
                stop
            else (no)
                if (Does the car crank up but fail to start?) then (yes)

                    if (Does the engine start and then die?) then (yes)
                        if (Does you car have fuel injection?) then (yes)
                            :Get it in for service.;

        Example Output
        Is the car silent when you turn the key? y
        Are the battery terminals corroded? n
        Replace cables and try again.

        Constraint
        Ask only questions that are relevant to the situation
        and to the previous answers. Donâ€™t ask for all inputs at once.*/
